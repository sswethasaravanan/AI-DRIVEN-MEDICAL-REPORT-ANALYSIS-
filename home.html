<h1>Welcome to Our Site</h1>
<p>This project leverages cutting-edge Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Generative AI technologies to transform medical report analysis. OCR is used to accurately convert images of text, such as scans of patient reports or medical documents, into digital, editable text formats. Once extracted, Generative AI processes this text to generate clear, concise summaries and insights. This tool is designed to save time, reduce manual work, and assist medical professionals in quickly deriving meaningful information from complex medical reports, ultimately aiding in faster diagnostic decisions and improved patient care.</p>

<p>Using this application is straightforward: simply upload a medical report, whether it's an image of a document or a digital scan, and let the AI take over. The system will extract and analyze the text, summarizing key findings and highlighting essential information, so you can focus on making informed clinical decisions rather than spending valuable time on data entry and interpretation.</p>
